One user can enter a word (or phrase, if you would like your game to support that), and another user attempts to guess the word.
Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related to the length of the word.
Repeated guesses do not count against the user.
The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word. So if the secret word is "unicorn", the user will start out seeing something like "_ _ _ _ _ _ _", which would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" after the user enters a guess of "c".
The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.


steps:
asks for word
user1 enters word
gets word
makes into array
asks for letter guess
user2 enters letter
searches array for letter
.each letter in array
if letter in array = letter, prints letter
if letter in array != letter, prints underscore
map! update array
asks for next letter
repeat
guess limit = length
if output = full word, congrats message
if output != full word, sad message

behaviors/methods: initialize, convert to array, .each over array to find letter, .map update word output
states/attributes: guess count, is over, word as array
attr_reader: word, guess count, is over
attr_accessor: none?
