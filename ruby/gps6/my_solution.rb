# Reflection Section
=begin
1. State data is using string keys, each state's respective hash is using symbol keys.
2. Require relative specifies information to be included from other files using a relative path. Files included with require are called with paths relative to current working directory, not Ruby file.
3. Each, each pair, each key
4. They were instance variables and we didn't need to pass anything because the instance were called in the child methods.
5. Instance scope vs. method scope, Don't Repeat Yourself
